Based on my analysis of your frontend app's initialization and loading behavior, I can identify several performance optimization opportunities. Here are my findings and recommendations:
Key Performance Issues:
Sequential Data Loading
Your app initializes data sequentially (user → media types → media)
This creates a waterfall of network requests that delays initial render
Redundant API Calls
Media types are fetched twice in quick succession
The logs show "Skipping media fetch - request already in progress with data"
Deferred Component Rendering
App waits for all data to load before rendering the interface
This increases perceived loading time significantly
Large Payload Sizes
Loading all media files upfront even when only showing thumbnails initially
This creates unnecessary network load
CSS Parsing Errors
Multiple CSS parsing errors indicate inefficient styles
Error messages like "Unknown pseudo-class or pseudo-element '-ms-input-placeholder'"
Inefficient Component Design
MediaLibrary component re-renders with full data processing on small state changes
Uses string-based localStorage for view mode preference
Optimization Recommendations:
Implement Parallel Data Loading
Fetch user, media types, and media in parallel instead of sequentially
Modify initializeApp() in App.tsx to use Promise.all for concurrent requests
Use Data Caching
Implement Redux middleware like redux-persist to cache data between sessions
Add TTL (time-to-live) for cached data to balance freshness vs performance
Implement Lazy Loading
Only load visible media items initially (pagination or virtual scrolling)
Implement image lazy loading for media cards/thumbnails
Code Splitting
Split your bundle using React.lazy() for route-based code splitting
Consider moving large dependencies (MUI, framer-motion) to dynamic imports
Optimize Redux State Management
Use RTK Query instead of manual thunks for caching and request deduplication
Implement more granular selectors to prevent unnecessary re-renders
Improve CSS Performance
Fix CSS parsing errors by removing outdated browser prefixes
Consider using CSS-in-JS with better tree-shaking capabilities
Implement Progressive Loading UI
Show a skeleton UI while data loads instead of CircularProgress
Load critical interface components before data is ready
Optimize Network Requests
Implement backend pagination API to limit initial data load
Use HTTP compression for API responses
Component Optimization
Use React.memo for pure components like MediaCard
Implement better memoization in the MediaLibrary component
Use useCallback for event handlers passed as props
CORS Headers Optimization
Fix the CORS issue with Authorization headers mentioned in console warnings
Would you like me to elaborate on any specific recommendation? Or would you prefer I create a more detailed implementation plan for one of these areas?
