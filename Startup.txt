Navigate to the Project Directory: Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory:

Install Dependencies: Ensure all dependencies are installed by running:

Set Up Environment Variables: Ensure you have a .env file in the project root with the following content:

Start the Backend Server: Start the backend server by running:

npm start
If everything is set up correctly, you should see output indicating that the server is running and connected to MongoDB:

MongoDB connected
Server is running on port 5002

Troubleshooting
MongoDB Connection Error: If you encounter an error related to MongoDB connection, ensure that the MONGO_URI in your .env file is correct and that your MongoDB server is accessible.

Environment Variables Not Loaded: Ensure that you have the dotenv package installed and that you are loading the environment variables at the beginning of your server.js file:
const dotenv = require('dotenv');
dotenv.config();
