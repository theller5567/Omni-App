Yes, React 19 and modern React in general have much better ways to handle caching and data fetching. While the manual caching approach we implemented works, it's more of a traditional solution that requires you to manage state and timing yourself.
Here are modern React approaches for better data fetching and caching:
1. React Query (TanStack Query)
This is the most popular solution for data fetching and caching in React applications:
Apply to UserActivity...
}
React Query handles caching, refetching, and loading states automatically. It provides:
Automatic cache invalidation
Deduplication of requests
Background refetching
Prefetching
Optimistic updates
2. React Cache API
React 19 introduces a native cache function for memoizing expensive computations or data fetches:
Apply to UserActivity...
}
3. React 19's Server Components with Suspense
With React 19, you can use Server Components with Suspense for data fetching:
Apply to UserActivity...
}
4. SWR (Stale-While-Revalidate)
Similar to React Query but slightly more lightweight:
Apply to UserActivity...
}
These modern approaches:
Eliminate manual cache management
Separate data fetching from UI components
Reduce boilerplate code
Handle complex loading states
Provide consistent patterns for your entire app
Are optimized for performance
The manual approach we implemented works fine, but transitioning to one of these solutions would give you better scalability, reduced complexity, and improved user experience with minimal code.
