Looking at your codebase, there are several areas where you could optimize performance by leveraging TanStack Query more effectively and addressing other performance bottlenecks. Here's an analysis of opportunities for significant speed improvements:
Areas to Implement or Improve TanStack Query Usage
Redux Media State → TanStack Query
In MediaLibraryPage.tsx, you're still using Redux dispatch to manage media state:
Apply to SystemSettin...
;
You're already starting the transition by updating the React Query cache:
Apply to SystemSettin...
;
Complete this migration by removing the Redux media slice and rely entirely on TanStack Query's cache.
User/Auth Management
Your application still uses Redux for user state:
Apply to SystemSettin...
;
Consider moving authentication state to TanStack Query with longer staleTime for optimal performance.
Tag Category Management
The fetchTagCategories dispatch in MediaLibrary.tsx could be replaced with a TanStack Query hook.
Performance Optimization Opportunities
Virtualization Improvements
Your DataTable uses virtualization, but there are additional optimizations:
Implement dynamic row heights for different content types
Add pagination for large datasets to reduce initial load time
Optimize column widths to reduce horizontal scrolling
Image Loading Optimization
Implement proper image lazy loading and progressive loading
Add image size optimization at the server level for thumbnails
Consider implementing a responsive image sizing strategy
Lazy Loading Components
Review your lazy loading strategy for components:
Apply to SystemSettin...
;
Group related components to reduce the number of bundle chunks
Prioritize above-the-fold components for initial loading
Memoization Opportunities
Your rows calculation uses useMemo, which is good:
Apply to SystemSettin...
;
Look for other expensive calculations or renders that aren't memoized
Add React.memo() to complex pure components
Network Request Batching
Implement request batching for operations that might trigger multiple API calls
Use TanStack Query's mutation batching capabilities
Implementation Plan for Biggest Impact
Here's a priority-ordered plan focusing on changes that would have the biggest impact:
1. Complete the Redux → TanStack Query Migration
Could not find file 'src/hooks/query-hooks.ts'. Did you mean one of: - frontend/src/hooks/query-hooks.ts
Based on my analysis of your codebase, here are the most important areas to optimize for better performance, focusing especially on TanStack Query implementation:
High-Impact Optimizations
1. Replace Redux with TanStack Query for Media Management
Redux state for media is causing unnecessary re-renders and duplicates your data management. Here's a plan to refactor:
Apply to SystemSettin...
;
Then in your MediaLibraryPage.tsx, replace:
Apply to SystemSettin...
;
With:
Apply to SystemSettin...
;
2. Add Better Response Caching Settings with TanStack Query
The current TanStack queries don't have optimized caching configurations. Enhance them like this:
Apply to SystemSettin...
;
3. Optimize the DataTable Component
The DataTable key issue is fixed, but you can further improve performance:
Virtual Scrolling: Enhance the current virtualization:
Apply to SystemSettin...
>
4. Add Data Prefetching for Common Navigation Paths
Add prefetching for media details when hovering over items in the list:
Apply to SystemSettin...
;
5. Implement Data Transformations at Query Level
Move data transformations to the query level instead of in component render:
Apply to SystemSettin...
;
Then use this in your MediaLibraryPage:
Apply to SystemSettin...
;
Implementation Priority
First Priority: Replace the Redux media management with TanStack Query
Second Priority: Optimize caching settings for all queries
Third Priority: Improve DataTable virtualization and rendering
Fourth Priority: Implement data transformations at query level
Fifth Priority: Add prefetching for common navigation paths
These changes will significantly improve your application's performance by:
Reducing redundant state management
Minimizing unnecessary re-renders
Optimizing data loading patterns
Improving virtualization for large data sets
Using query caching more effectively
Would you like me to help implement any of these specific optimizations? We could start with the highest-impact changes first.


Yes, I understand. You're proposing an approval workflow for new and updated MediaFiles. Before any MediaFile or its modifications become visible to standard users, it must be reviewed and approved by an Admin or SuperAdmin. This involves:
Flagging: Marking new/edited MediaFiles as pending_approval.
Notifications: Alerting Admin/SuperAdmin users about these pending items.
Visibility Control: Ensuring only approved content is publicly accessible.
This is a common and valuable feature for content moderation and quality control.
Regarding your request for my opinion and ideas for improvement, here are some thoughts:
Core Considerations & Potential Enhancements:
MediaFile Status:
You'll need a new field in your MediaFile model/interface (e.g., approvalStatus with possible values like pending, approved, rejected, needs_revision).
Enhancement: Consider what happens on rejected. Is it a soft delete? Does it go back to the uploader with feedback? The needs_revision status could be useful for a feedback loop.
Handling Edits to Approved Content:
If an already approved MediaFile is edited, the current live version should ideally remain public until the new edits are approved. This prevents content from disappearing while under review.
If an edit is rejected, the MediaFile should revert to its last approved state.
Enhancement (Version History): For more robust tracking, especially with edits, you might consider a simple versioning system. This could be as simple as storing the "live" version and the "pending" version, or a more complex history if needed.
User Experience (Submitter):
The user who submitted the MediaFile should be able to see the status of their submissions (e.g., in their profile or a "My Submissions" area).
Enhancement: Allow submitters to withdraw a pending submission or perhaps even make changes if it's sent back as needs_revision.
Admin/SuperAdmin Workflow:
Notification System: How will admins be alerted? An in-app notification system, a dedicated dashboard page listing items awaiting approval, or email notifications are common.
Review Interface: Admins will need a clear interface to see pending items. For edits, a "diff" view highlighting changes would be very helpful.
Feedback Mechanism: Allow admins to provide a reason for rejection or if revisions are needed. This feedback should be visible to the submitter.
Enhancement (Bulk Actions): If you anticipate many submissions, admins would benefit from bulk approval/rejection capabilities.
Defining "Public":
Clarify who can see what. Typically, the submitter and admins can see pending/rejected files, while regular users only see approved ones.
Impact on Current Code:
MediaUploader.tsx: The onUploadComplete function will need to be modified. Instead of the file being immediately "live", it will be created with a pending status. The success message might also need to reflect that it's submitted for approval.
Data Fetching Hooks (e.g., useMediaTypes, useUserById if it fetches associated media): Backend APIs and frontend hooks will need to be updated. By default, queries for media should probably only return approved files for regular users. Admins would need a way to fetch files with other statuses.
Display Components: Any component rendering lists or details of MediaFiles will need to respect the approvalStatus.
Further Ideas:
Moderation Queue: A dedicated section in the admin panel for managing the approval queue.
Audit Trail: Logging who approved/rejected a MediaFile and when.
Granular Permissions (Future): Potentially, different user roles could have different approval powers, or some MediaTypes might bypass approval if submitted by trusted users.
Before we start coding, it would be beneficial to decide on:
The exact states for approvalStatus (e.g., pending, approved, rejected, needs_revision).
How edits to existing approved files are handled (does the old one stay live?).
The basic notification and review process for admins.
Your current plan is a great starting point, and these considerations can help flesh out the details for a more comprehensive system. What are your initial thoughts on these points?
