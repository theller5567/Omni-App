1. When deleting mediaFIles and then navigation to the mediaTYpe page the mediaTYpe page is not updated with the new list of mediaFIles. The mediaTYpe page is still showing the old list of media.

2. Create Tag categories/groups
    2A. Implement tag categories in all forms that require multiselect options or tags.

3. Run React Scan on application, checking for optimization and data bottlenecks
    3A. Make sure data is only fetched when needed and components only rendered when needed.
    3B. Reduce request calls and make more efficient

4. Make sure all pages are authorized by the correct User role permission - Who can do what?
    
5. Create a log for each user actions.

6. Add a review system where only a admin or superAdmin can approve new mediaFiles and Types.
    6A. Add a notification system using users email when they need to review a file or type.

7. Add More Tracking Points: Integrate with other controllers like mediaTypeController
Implement Retention Policy: Add functionality to clean up old logs
Add Dashboard Analytics: Create endpoints that provide aggregated statistics
Add Real-time Notifications: Use WebSockets to notify admins of important activities
Add Export Functionality: Allow downloading logs in CSV or Excel format

Check for Race conditions.

THink about using useQuery instead of useFetch.

Allow user to search mediaFiles with a mediaType of videoThumbnail when creating or updating a video thumbnail.

MediaTYpes
    when adding a new field, when the user forgets to click on the add button and hits next, give the user a message asking if they want to add the field.


Use inline Notifications instead of toast notifications. 
I am getting redundant messages and sometimes the user is unable to view the toast notification because 
it is behind the popup they are looking at.


Eventually remove the ability for users to create their own tags and only allow the user to use existing tags or existing tagCategories

New mediaFIles should not be visible to all users below admin roles if not yet approved by an admin. 
unapproved mediaFIles should show up in a component under the dashboard called nonApprovedMediaFiles.
An admin should be able to approve or disapprove a mediaFile as well as add a note on why the media 
file was disapproved that would be sent via email to the user who created the mediaFile
